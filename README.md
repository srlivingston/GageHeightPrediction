##Desciption
This code implements an LSTM Model to predict channel depth and gage height. The code for the training model is located in the gageheight2.py.

##Use of model
In order to use the model as it is, download the predictValues.py file, pinn_model.pth, location_categories, train_mean.csv, and train_std.csv. (All of these files can also be generated by training the model using the gageheight2.py)
To run the model ensure the paths in the predictValues are all pointing to the correct place and whatever data you are using for predicting is structured like the Training_Data.csv file but with Channel Depth and Discharge missing.

##Data
All data should be in metric except for discharge (ft^3/s) and precipitation (in). Those are converted in the code. They are left as imperial in the data because that is how they come from the USGS.
